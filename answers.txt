• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
Ans:- gitignore file is used to ignore specific files which are not needed like  .log files
	  These files typcially are of no use. For Java project we typically have .class files, .war, .tar files
	  which are of no use to other developers. So, by placing them in .gitignore when pushing the files with
	  the extensions in the .git will not be pushed to remote.
		
• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Ans:- Suppose say when you merge a branch into master. And the branch is ahead of master, then the git
	  automatically updates the master reference to the commit of the branch. This is called fast-forwarding.
		
		
• Why should you have different branches?
Ans:- By having branches the workflow is not interrupted. Suppose in a team if there are 5 people then usually 
	  that 5 people will work on different components.
	  So, having five different branches will help them to focus on their part regardless
	  of the work happening on other components.
		
		
• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Ans:- Usually, there is no such number. Generally we will have one remote repository and the developers 
	  clone that into local and work on them.
